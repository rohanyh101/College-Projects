# College Projects

projects completed during my college studies.

## Project 1: Path Planning for Autonomous Race car (major project)

- **Description:** In basic terms,Path Planning means developing an optimal racing line is the shortest path through a race circuit to achieve the best lap-time. Developing an optimal racing line algorithm will help the teams in Racing Compitations to compute the optimal path for new tracks, improving the vehicleâ€™s overall performance.

## Project 2: Speech Recognition in Autonomous car (mini project)

- **Description:** In this model, cross correlation was implemented in MATLAB to compare two or more signals and detect the most accurate one of the all by finding the percetage of similarity between our recorded Signal signal and the testing signals.
